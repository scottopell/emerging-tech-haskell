Emerging Technology - Haskell
=====================
Haskell is a high-level, purely functional programming language with a strong static type system and elegant mathematical underpinnings. It is being increasingly used in industry by organizations such as Facebook, AT&T, and NASA, along with several financial firms. This course explores the joys of functional programming, using Haskell as a vehicle. In the first part of the course, you will learn to use Haskell to easily and conveniently write practical programs. The last couple of weeks will consist of several special topics that explore advanced features of Haskell.

This is a duplicated of [http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/] with some small modifications.

# Plan of study

This course is self-led and should follow this plan for new topics and homeworks.

Each homework is due (turned in via email to advisor) by the start of the following week unless otherwise noted.

So homework 1 is due by the start of week 2. Each session starts on Monday, so homework 1 is due by the Sunday at 11:59pm

## Grading

The class is pass/fail. A pass will be awarded if greater than 60% of the homework assignments are completed on time and the final project is completed on time. A fail will be assigned if the final project is not completed or 60% or less of the homework assignments are completed. 

## Late work

No late work is accepted. However, assignments and projects may be turned in early.
